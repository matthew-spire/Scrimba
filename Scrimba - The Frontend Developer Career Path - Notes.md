#### 6. Let's Make a Cake!

- Lot of stuff going on and may be overwhelming, but no need to understand majority right now
- Make a small modification
  - Hover over the egg and note the "scared" animation &rarr; look @ HTML code, see the egg, and also see "scared"

    - Can see the note by returning to screen cast where note was written as well as from the main menu (Where on main menu?)
  - Go into index.js and change the theme from 'light' to 'dark'
    - `setTheme('light')` to `setTheme('dark')`
- Click on settings wheel in bottom right corner to change font size, speed, etc.
  - Also where you can download the code as a ZIP

### Your first web app

#### 1. Add your Name and Emoji

- Web app that is personalized, unique, and just for you
- Technologies used to run the web app
  - CSS
    - Colors, backgrounds, fonts, variables
  - JavaScript
    - Conditionals, loops, fetch, functions
  - React
    - Props, APIs, hooks, JSX, state
  - Scary words &rarr; concepts and technologies that are being used to render the web app in the browser
    - Scary, but you need to get comfortable with the fact that when working as a frontend developer you are always standing on the shoulders of giants and there are always things going on under the hood that you do not understand
  - Have to accept that you will sometimes work on and-or with things you do not understand
    - ~80 lines of scary, hideous code you have to work w/
      - Limited to modifying a few lines
      - Only worry about/try to understand the lines you are modifying
- Make it your website
  - Change the name from 'Someone' to your name and change the emoji
    - `ReactDOM.render(<App name="Someone" emoji="ðŸ‘‹" />, document.getElementByID("root"));` &rarr;
    - `ReactDOM.render(<App name="Matthew" emoji="ðŸ¦„" />, document.getElementByID("root"));`
    - Can copy and paste an emoji from [getemoji.com](https://getemoji.com/)
  - Site is still boring, so we need to populate it with content

#### 2. Display Photos

- In index.js, the return(...); statement (function?) (i.e. the code) is set up to display pictures
  - No pictures are currently being displayed because there is nothing specifying what kind of photos to display on the website
    - Specify on line 24 of index.js
      - Uses a modern React concept called Hooks (Do not worry about this now, just be aware of it)
    - Set up the app so that it starts off with an initial state
      - Initial state &rarr; Whatever you put into useState("") on line 24 of index.js
      - Fill in w/ name of subject that you want your website to be populated w/ images of &rarr; refresh the code and observe the result
- How are pictures "magically" showing up on the page?
  - Use of an API (line 29 of index.js)
    - Unsplash is a website that contains free to use images
    - Our app sent a request to Unsplash requesting images &rarr; Unsplash said yes &rarr; Unsplash sent images of our specified subject back to our app &rarr; Our app took that date (images) and rendered out the photos
      - Using Internet infrastructure to construct something which pulls data from a third party source
- Now, change the background color, fonts, etc. to better match your subject selection

#### 3. Change the Background Image

- Personalize your website by styling it
  - Style websites by working with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
    - Go into style.css file
      - Note the background options under the root section (lines 3 through 12 of style.css)
      - Change the background to one you like
        - Modify line 44 of style.css
          - `--background-image: var(--wooden);` &rarr; `--background-image: var(--rainbow);`
      - Only changing what is in the var statements

#### 4. Choose a Color

- Change the font, border, etc. color to suit the subject you chose
  - Still in style.css
  - Note the color options under the root section
  - Modify line 49 of style.css
    - `--main-color: var(--snow)` &rarr; `--main-color: var(--gloom)`
- Important aspect of coding is that one variable can change many things on the page
  - Main reason we use variables

#### 5. Set the Font, Border, and Column Count

- Change the font family to one you like better
  - Still in style.css
  - Note the font options under the root section
  - Modify line 54 of style.css
    - `font-family: var(--simple-font);` &rarr; `font-family: var(--curly-font);`
- Adjust how many columns you would like to have
  - Modify line 60 of style.css
    - `column-count: 2;` &rarr; `column-count: 3;`
- Choose your favorite border
  - Uncomment the code (lines 71 and 73 in style.css)
  - Modify line 72 of style.css
    - Use the variables available for backgrounds
    - `/* border-image: var(--sweets) 100; */` &rarr; `border-image: var(--nightsky) 100;`
- Note how we modify different sections in style.css
  - E.g. body, grid, etc.

#### 6. Share your website

- Share your solution
  - Do the mini challenges (again) to make the website your style
  - Share a screenshot in the i-built-this channel on Discord
